# guessingGame

A lightweight number guessing game written in Java.

The goal was to create a pop-up window using the JOptionPane to enter the numbers instead of playing it in the terminal.

Future App Goals:
  - Create a "Winner!" or "Game Over!" pop up or animation for each corresponding play.
  - Run this as an executable application instead of firing it up in VS Code. Would like to double-click a desktop icon and play that way.
